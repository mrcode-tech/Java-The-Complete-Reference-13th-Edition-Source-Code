/**
 * Value-based classes are a concept introduced in Java to represent objects whose equality is based on their contents rather
 * than their identity. This means that two instances of a value-based class are considered equal if they have the same content,
 * even if they are distinct objects in memory.
 *
 * In Java, value-based classes should adhere to the principles of value-based programming, which include:
 *
 * Immutability: Instances of a value-based class should be immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed after they are created.
 *
 * Finality: Value-based classes should be declared as final to prevent subclassing, ensuring that their behavior remains consistent.
 *
 * Deterministic: The behavior of value-based classes should be deterministic; given the same inputs, they should always produce the same result.
 *
 * Equals and Hashcode: Value-based classes should override the equals() and hashCode() methods based on their content.
 *
 * Serializable: Value-based classes should implement Serializable to support serialization.
 *
 * Java's standard library provides several examples of value-based classes, including String, Integer, LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, and others.
 *
 * Here's an example using LocalDate:
 */
public class ValueBasedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 28);
        LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 28);

        // Value-based equality
        System.out.println(date1.equals(date2)); // true

        // Identity check
        System.out.println(date1 == date2); // false
    }
    /**
     * In this example, LocalDate is a value-based class, and two instances with the same content are considered equal.
     *
     * By adhering to the principles of value-based programming, Java can optimize the memory usage and performance of these
     * classes in certain contexts, such as in collections and caching. Additionally,
     * it promotes a more intuitive understanding of equality based on the values rather than the identity of objects
